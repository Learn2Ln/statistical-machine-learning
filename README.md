Assignments for Statistical Machine Learning (NWI-NB054E)

1. Polynomial fitting, Gradient descent and probability theory
2. Sequential learning (ML and MAP estimates)
3. Bayesian Linear Regression and Logistic Regression with IRLS optimization
4. Gaussian processes, Neural Networks and Expectation Maximazation for Gaussian Mixture Models

Each assignment was implemented in Python in a Jupyter notebook (except for 3, which was done in Julia).
